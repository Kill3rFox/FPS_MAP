# FPS Map

Description
This project creates an old style FPS map similar to games like Doom. This was made to help me learn more about persepctive and level layout, as well as an exercise to conduct in C++ so that I may become more familiar with the language.

How to Install and Run
The project should be able to easily run through Visual studio. If there is trouble with the map properly displaying in the console, I would recommend resizing your cmd window in the properties section.

Credits
This project was made following the tutorial linked below, loving this guys stuff and the things i'm learning from him.
